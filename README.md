# Antony E

👋 Hi, I'm Antony. I am a Software Engineer at [100 Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/). 
While studying Information Systems, I found out that what I was truly passionate about was coding. Ever since then, 2021, I have used Software Development both as a hobby as well as to develop products in my life. I like to deliver best quality products working close to the business and with an Agile mindset.
I believe in continuous improvement and look for opportunities to learn, to share knowledge while having fun.
